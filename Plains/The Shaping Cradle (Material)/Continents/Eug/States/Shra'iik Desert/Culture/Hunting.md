Upon dealing with the recently made enemy, they then strip the body of any possessions, keeping things that are valuable and worthwhile to their survival, rather than most races that would keep things of economic value. After this process, the head is removed, given blessing in the native tongue and promptly buried (the reasoning for this will be explained in the religion section). The rest of the corpse is put into different sections of torso, legs and arms (differing with varying races). Nothing of the corpse is wasted with every piece of hair, skin and even eyes used for something (see material uses and weapons). The meat is eaten raw as cooked food is only used during the Chki or “meeting of people.”
