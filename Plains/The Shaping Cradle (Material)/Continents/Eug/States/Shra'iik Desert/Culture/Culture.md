Not much is known about this nomadic and secretive people to other races. Mainly keeping to themselves and disliking other races due to liking the company of their kin and clan. They are a chaotic neutral people, and will not attack or be aggressive unless provoked, or in the event of no other food source. 

 They like to be respectful of the land they thrive on and with a short life span of only ~30 years they spend every day like it’s their last, making the most of it. However, some have been said to live marginally longer, acting as a guide to others within their tribe, and in rare cases outside of them.

These tribes/clans/packs can contain 2-25 Thri Kreen, with a rare single group of 30 where there is more of a hierarchy present.
