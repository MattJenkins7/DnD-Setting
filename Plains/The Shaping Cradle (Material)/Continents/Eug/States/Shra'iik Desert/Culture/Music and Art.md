Using a mix of their mandibles and wings they are able to make sounds akin to overtone singing, and while doing this they connect minds with one another, singing songs of their ancestors and the land they hold so dear to their kind. No other race knows what these songs sound like or how to do it as the Thri Kreen do, making it a completely unique way of making music that only a single race knows.
