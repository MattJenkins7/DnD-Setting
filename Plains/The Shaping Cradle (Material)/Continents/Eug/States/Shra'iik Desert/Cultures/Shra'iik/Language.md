The Thri Kreen converse a language known as Shra’iik speak which utilises a mixture of clicking, clacking and visual language with their mandibles and antennae, and is mainly used for quick communications when doing things such as hunting, being hunted or passively. For more emotive needs they use their telepathic abilities to speak to one another in a way that is less words and more feeling and emotions.

To speak to races outside of their kin they use these telepathic abilities in the same way, they cannot however understand something said back to them unless it is in Shra’iik speak or common.
