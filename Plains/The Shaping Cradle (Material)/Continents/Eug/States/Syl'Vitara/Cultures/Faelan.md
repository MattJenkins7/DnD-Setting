## Ancestry
The Faelan pixies are beings formed from the pure essence of magic, which is why they are constantly shedding the effulgent pixie dust, a powerful magical catalyst.
These pixies come from the leyline convergence that falls in the centre of the Himlielu Lake, beneath the great tree of Didryhera, where a great powerful source of magical concentration falls.
