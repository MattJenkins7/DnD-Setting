## Ancestry
The Garashan Goliaths are said to have come from a race of mountain giants who roamed the lands long before civilization. These giants, though long extinct, share facets of the Garashan's day to day life such as their trepidation when contacting society, which leads them to staying atop the mountain ridges of Valandor and Elarion in solitude.
