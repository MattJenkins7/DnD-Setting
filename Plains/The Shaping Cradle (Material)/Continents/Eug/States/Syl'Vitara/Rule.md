Syl'Vitara is ruled by the Elvish population through a combination of democratic government, monarchy and local governments.

### Local Government
Local government varies on area. Some towns elect a singular ruling mayor, some towns elect a triarch council who will often consist of individuals of merchantry, military, and scholarly backgrounds in order to preserve balance. In towns of importance to the area, a regional steward is elected by the monarchy who oversees activity in the area and is an extension of the central command.
