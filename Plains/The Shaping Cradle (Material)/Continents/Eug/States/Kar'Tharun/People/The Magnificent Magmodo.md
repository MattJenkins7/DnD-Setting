#### Breath Weapon (Recharge 5–6).
Magmodo exhales a destructive breath in a 60-foot cone. Creatures in the area must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw, taking 56 (16d6) damage on a failed save or half as much on a success. The damage type is one of the following, chosen by Magmodo at the time of use: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison.
#### Merchant's Hoard (6 Charges).

Choose one:

###### Binding Chains
A set of glowing chains restrains a creature within 30 feet (DC 19 Strength saving throw to break free).
###### Explosion Orb

###### Draconic Command (Recharge 5–6).
Magmodo issues a commanding roar. Each creature of Magmodo's choice within 60 feet must make a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed or frightened (Magmodo’s choice) for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
