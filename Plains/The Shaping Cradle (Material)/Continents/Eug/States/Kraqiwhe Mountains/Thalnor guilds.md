Firbolg Heretics who have replaced reverence for the universe and its systems with a modernist, utilitarian perspective: they are aware of divinity but reject the idea that it, or the world around them, is worthy of worship. as such they exploit magic to its limits and are focused on unlocking the secrets of the universe. their territory in the Kraqiwhe mountains is divided into technocratic guilds of wizards and artificers, who mostly keep to themselves save for the sharing/trading of resources or knowledge. second in influence in their society is the trading guilds who practically run the economy, although the mage guilds hold a monopoly on force due to the sheer capacity for destructive magic and constructs at their service.
