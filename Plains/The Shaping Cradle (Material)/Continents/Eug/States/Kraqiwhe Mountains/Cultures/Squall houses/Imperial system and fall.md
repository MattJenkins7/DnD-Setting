the Thalnor heretics, who would eventually consolidate as the Thalnor Guilds, were expelled en masse from their homeland and found out that the short-lived and divided Squall houses made for easy prey when picked apart and played off one another. the Heretics waged 100 years of gradually seizing land from the houses until an agreement on solid borders could be negotiated with the surviving houses once the capital fell and the emperor was killed.

the increasingly disinterested and disorganised heretics settled down and focused on building from the ashes of the civilisation they now held dominion over, while the houses who kept their land begun the long process of recovery.
