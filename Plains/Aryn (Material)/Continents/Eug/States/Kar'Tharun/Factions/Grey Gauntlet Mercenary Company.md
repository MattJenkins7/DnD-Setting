### **The Grey Gauntlet Mercenary Company**

**Motto:** _"Bound by coin, tempered in war."_

The **Grey Gauntlet** is a **neutral mercenary band** known for its professionalism and refusal to engage in wanton cruelty. They take contracts from **city-states, noble houses, and merchant guilds**, operating in [[Plains/The Shaping Cradle (Material)/Continents/Eug/States/Kar'Tharun/Cities/Stonefang Hold|Stonefang Hold]] Hold, and the surrounding regions**. The Gauntlet does not fight for causes—**only for coin**—though their reputation for **honor among mercenaries** has earned them loyal clients.

### **Structure & Ideology**

- **Unsworn Blades:** New recruits.
- **Ironbound:** Full-fledged members, bearing a steel insignia ring.
- **Gauntlet Captains:** Squad leaders.
- **The Hand of Iron:** The council of veteran mercenaries.
- **First Fist:** The supreme commander of the Grey Gauntlet.

The Grey Gauntlet has been **hired for border skirmishes, city defense, and high-profile escorts**, though there are whispers of **hidden contracts tied to the plague in Stonefang Hold and a deeper political game at play.**
