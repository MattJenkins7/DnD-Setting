### Location
The only settlement of the Shra'iik people located on the banks of the grand lake of iik (where the name Shra'iik comes from, Shra meaning people of, iik meaning the grand lake). A meeting of all the clans and tribes happens here every year, where people come to share in experiences, food and many artistic traditions described in the "[[Plains/The Shaping Cradle (Material)/Continents/Eug/States/Shra'iik Desert/Culture/Music and Art|Music and Art]]" section.

### Architecture and Infrastructure
Makhan has only one grand building carved out of the sandstone mountains next to iik, full of precise works and stories telling of the Shra'iik, woven into the stone. The architecture is similar to that of the carvings in Petra, with a more natural and flowing feel to it. 

### Trade
Every year when the tribes gather they bring their finds and wares, each trading with each other. The way they manage trade is very different to other regens and cultures, where instead of currency they exchange goods with goods, sometimes of equal value, sometimes not, depending on the need.

Makhan is also where the great spirit leader [[Plains/The Shaping Cradle (Material)/Continents/Eug/States/Shra'iik Desert/People/Shra'Arsh|Shra'Arsh]] resides, caring for the settlement with his clan of guides called the [[Shra'Chki]] which translates to "people of the soul."
Shra'Arsh is held in high regard as he is the descendent of the first or "Arsh" (in local dialect).
His ancester [[Arsh'Eisaf]] (first of the sand) led the Shra'iik through the desert to iik, where they carved the building of Makhan, making it a settlement for the people of iik. To this day the reasoning for why they left their original homeland remains a mystery, even to the present day Shra'iik themselves, but to them the desert and the grand lake have always been home, and shall always be.
