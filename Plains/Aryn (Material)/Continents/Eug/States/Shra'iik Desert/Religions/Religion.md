The Thri’Kreen beliefs vary from tribe to tribe due to differing experiences and general distance between them. They do however share many core beliefs such as: 

- The essence of a living being's life is located within the head.
- The land and everything within this plain must be respected.
- When killing a creature, sentient or not, must be given a blessing.
- An annual meeting of tribe leaders must be held at the religious centre of . every summer, with ceremonies and celebrations to be had.

To be clear, the Thri’Kreen do not have a god or gods in the general sense, they instead honour and praise that which is around them, including each other. For example, when completing a hunt for the tribe (in which most/all of them partake), everyone is congratulated and celebrated while enjoying the recently gained prize. The prize is also blessed after killing, with its head removed and buried.
