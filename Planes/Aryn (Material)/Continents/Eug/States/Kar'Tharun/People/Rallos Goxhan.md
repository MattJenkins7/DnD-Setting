#### **Early Life and Aspirations**

Rallos was born in the city of Stonefang Hold to a family of devout scholars. Raised in the hallowed halls of the Thaumaturgic Conservatory, he was taught from an early age that knowledge was the highest pursuit, and that understanding the divine weave of magic was both a responsibility and a privilege. Unlike many of his peers, who focused on traditional arcane practices, Rallos was drawn to the mysteries of the planes—specifically, the unseen forces that shaped them.

By the age of 24, he had earned a place as an Arcanist within the High Assembly, where he studied the nature of leylines and extraplanar resonance. His early research gained him some renown, particularly his work on _Soul Windows_—arcane devices capable of transmitting minute traces of planar energy into comprehensible signals. His ultimate goal was to bridge the gaps between planes, to create a dialogue with realms beyond understanding.

#### **The Discovery of the Abyss**

For years, Rallos meticulously charted the energies of the known planes. His research confirmed what scholars had believed for centuries: each plane existed within a cosmic order, bound by divine and elemental forces. However, his calculations contained an anomaly—an unexplained siphoning of magical energy from the edges of the planar map.

His studies led him to the discovery of a hidden plane, one that should not exist: the Abyss. Unlike the elemental and divine realms, the Abyss did not resonate with the ordered magic of the universe. It was a void—a wound in reality itself. Rallos should have stopped there, but his curiosity overruled his caution.

Using his Soul Window prototype, he attempted to listen. The device returned only silence at first, then whispers, then voices. He believed he had made first contact with an unknown force. The more he listened, the more the Abyss responded.

#### **Meinos: The Whispering Hunger**

At first, Rallos thought he was communicating with a fragmented consciousness, a remnant of a forgotten deity. But as time passed, the voice became singular. It called itself _Meinos_. It claimed to be ancient beyond reckoning, a being that had witnessed the birth of the planes.

Meinos promised knowledge. It spoke of leylines beyond mortal comprehension, of the cyclical nature of creation and destruction. Rallos, believing he had discovered the greatest secret in history, documented everything Meinos told him. But as he recorded these revelations, his work began to change. The symbols he wrote shifted when he looked away. Sentences he did not remember writing appeared in his notes.

His colleagues noticed the change. His manner grew erratic. He spoke in half-truths and riddles. When confronted, he assured them that his work was proceeding as planned. But by then, he had already begun modifying his Soul Window, not just to listen—but to _open_.

#### **Abhaddan’s Warning**

The true gods took notice. The ancient being _Abhaddan, the Soul Shaper_, had long been absent from mortal affairs, but it was Abhaddan who acted first. A warning came to Rallos in a dream—an overwhelming presence that demanded he cease his work. He woke with his mind filled with visions of a great unraveling.

For a moment, Rallos considered abandoning his research. He wrote a final entry in his journal, noting his intention to destroy the Soul Window. But the Abyss had already taken root.

That night, Meinos whispered something new. Not knowledge, not promises. A single phrase:

_"You are already mine."_

By the time the High Assembly arrived at his lab the next morning, Rallos was gone. The Soul Window was open.

#### **The Takeover and the Fall**

When Rallos activated the Soul Window, it did not merely serve as a portal—it served as a vessel. Meinos did not exist in the way that gods or demons did; it was a thought, an absence, a parasite of consciousness. It did not invade Rallos’ body—it _rewrote_ him. His mind became a canvas, overwritten word by word, until nothing of the man remained.

The thing that wore his face walked out of the lab, left Kar-Tharun, and vanished.

But Meinos was not yet whole. It required a bridge, a way to extend itself further into the material world. It needed _devotion_. Rallos’ writings, scattered and incomplete, were found in the ruins of his lab. Those who read them were drawn to his words, as if the knowledge itself was alive, seeking new vessels. Cults formed in secret, whispering the name Meinos in the dark.

#### **Abhaddan’s Return and the Looming War**

Abhaddan did not interfere directly. The old god had long been absent, reduced to legend even among scholars. But now, something stirred. Across the planes, echoes of a presence lost to time began to resurface. Temples long abandoned found their altars glowing faintly. Priests who had never spoken the name Abhaddan before found themselves murmuring it in their sleep.

For the first time in an age, the Soul Shaper was waking.

And Meinos knew it.

The war between these two ancient forces would not be waged in the heavens, nor in the Abyss. It would be waged in the minds of mortals. Every scholar who read Rallos’ final words, every desperate soul who sought forbidden knowledge, every broken mind that gazed into the Abyss would become a battlefield.

The question now was simple:  
Would Abhaddan wake in time to stop what had begun?

Or had Meinos already won?
