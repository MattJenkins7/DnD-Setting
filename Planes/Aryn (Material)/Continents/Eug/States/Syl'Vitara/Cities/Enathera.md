Enathera, meaning "Lake's watch" in elvish, is a Syl'Vitaran town and the twin to Ynathethin, located on the shore of 
Belran Lake. This town thrives on its proximity to both the dense forest and the expansive 
waters, embodying a perfect blend of woodland and aquatic lifestyles. Enathera is renowned for 
its skilled herbalists and healers who utilize the rich biodiversity of the forest to create 
potent remedies and elixirs. The town’s structures are built into the natural landscape, with 
homes nestled among ancient trees and connected by winding pathways. The elves of Enathera are 
deeply spiritual, often holding rituals by the lake’s edge to honor the spirits of nature. The 
strong kinship with Ynathethin fosters a unique cultural exchange, with shared traditions and 
cooperative ventures that enhance the prosperity and unity of both towns.

The town harbours a small branch of The Coinwrights, led by Aephas Gallinaas, who have a small but tight grip on the docks and dock workers, who are being taxed extortionate rates of their cut due to blackmail they hold over the city rule.

##### City Rule
The city is under Elven Rule, using a triarchic structure, and are led by the three Elves: Faereth Lirien, Sylwen Elora, and Orvil Thandorin.
