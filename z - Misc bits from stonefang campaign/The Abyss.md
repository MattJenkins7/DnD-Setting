### **DM Notes – Oryn’s Lead & The Leyline Convergence Site**

- **Oryn’s Information to the Party**
    
    - Rallos had a **particular fixation** on a remote site where leyline activity was anomalous.
    - The place is ancient—**older than civilization**—and the inscriptions there **predate any known written language.**
    - Rallos believed it was once used to **pierce the boundary between planes**, though Oryn never fully understood how.
    - The site’s convergence suggests it is **not tied to a single plane** but is a rare **multi-planar nexus** where the fabric of existence is thinner.
- **The Truth About the Site**
    
    - This location is not just a **leyline convergence** but a **junction of planar frames** where different planes intersect naturally.
    - The **Abyss, being a sub-plane of the Material Plane, has its own leylines**—but they do not connect to any other plane except the Material.
    - This site is the **only known place where the Abyssal leylines directly overlap with those of the Material Plane.**
    - If Rallos **activates or manipulates this point, he could create a stable bridge** between the Abyss and the Material, allowing the **transport of spirits** across.
- **What the Party Finds There**
    
    - The site is **ancient and in ruins**, with visible **leyline fractures** forming **strange glowing patterns** in the ground.
    - The **air is unstable**, with flickering illusions of other planes appearing momentarily.
    - The party might find remnants of **Rallos’ past work**, possibly old notes or abandoned experiments.
    - **Something is already happening**—the leylines are being disturbed, **indicating Rallos may have already started his work.**
