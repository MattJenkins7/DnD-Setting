## To-do

##### Magmodo offers himself as celestial aid to the party through a signet ring holding his soul
First combat is against a risen army of undead swarms, featuring the lair actions of abhaddan, fighting against the controller, the bard meinos who is controlling them, once magmodo is summoned the party notices meinos change his tune a bit (DC 20 Perception/Arcana) They start to target whomever has the ring, once the ring is obtained meinos he disapparates into sparkling ephemeral dust, sparkling in the radiance of the party's magic. Left with the onslaught of the remaining swarm to deal with after he leaves.


### How does the party find the ancient Mausoleum, from which abhaddan was banished many many years ago atop the giant peak of mount tharun?

### Room layout, first room, Hall type crypt depicting draconic inscriptions on pillars and walls, Giant Statue of Meiraxeis in the centre with a plaque, initial puzzle requires party to prove good alignment or connection to Tharun (Magmodo reason to be here?), abhaddan used the thaudarii to get in

### Hallway corridor, opens out to a maze of tapestry, outlining the true story of the banishment of abhaddan, "the Sundering of the Divine". In the centre of the maze something on the same level (floor) as the rest to get them to the next room. Next room contains two chained thaudarii looking disheveled, bruised hurt and disfiguired tied to posts with gags and binds, magical auras surround them (anti magic) pools of glowing golden ichor adorns the floor beneath them in a huge sprawling hall of the dead, crypts line every surface of the left and right walls, and coffins fill other empty space, a podium is up a small set of stairs to a 20ft, double door magnificently engraved onyx black volcanic rock (this is where the combat takes place. At least two more rooms before the final giant hall in which a portal is being constructed. 

Things to remember:
incorporate lair actions in the rooms
each room needs a reason to go to it, the tapestry the plaques in the first room contains key information.


### **Tapestry Description** - Get notes of

A vast, **winding tapestry** spans the length of the great hall, its silken threads woven with gold, silver, and crimson. The fabric shifts subtly as though imbued with the lingering echoes of history, telling the tale of a war that reshaped the cosmos.

At the leftmost edge, the first panel is **blackened**, stitched with silver threads depicting the brooding figure of **Abhaddan, the Shaper**, his many hands twisting the fates of mortals like strands of thread. Around him stand his **progeny**, the once-demigods, their figures noble but their eyes devoid of true divinity. **Smoke coils from their forms, the first hint of their doom.**

In the next segment, the **three dragons—Tharun, Kaelgor, and Meiraxeis—are depicted in their primal might**, their wings spanning across the cosmos. **Tharun** is bathed in a radiant white-gold glow, his great spear piercing the heavens. **Kaelgor** is wreathed in seething flame, his gaze filled with the fire of ambition. **Meiraxeis**, the most enigmatic, shimmers in shades of deep blue and violet, her form half-dissolving into shadow and stars. **Below them, their champions rise—mighty beings, celestial and terrestrial, wielding weapons of divine origin.**

The third panel is chaotic—a battlefield of collapsing realms. **Abhaddan’s progeny** are shown **falling**, their divine halos shattering as their power is revoked, their screams immortalized in frozen golden thread. **Kaelgor and Tharun stand together**, the brothers-in-arms, cleaving through the abyssal tide. **Meiraxeis, high above, is shown weaving an immense spell, the edges of her wings beginning to fray.**

A jagged rift bisects the next scene—**the birth of the Abyss**. **Meiraxeis' form is unraveling, her soul cast into the void**, the swirling darkness below swallowing her sacrifice. **Abhaddan himself is absent, his fate sealed in unknown chains beyond mortal comprehension.**

Then, a moment of stillness before the final betrayal. **Kaelgor, now alone, stands before the radiant figure of Tharun, his eyes dark with unquenched hunger.** The golden stitching of his form flickers **with cracks of crimson and black**—the first sign of his fall. The tapestry’s stitches grow chaotic, as if the weaver herself grew frantic at what unfolded. **A blade, a strike, an unknown exchange, and then—Tharun ascends, golden light consuming all.**

The final panel is stark—**Kaelgor, diminished, kneels in shadow, his divinity fractured, bound in a false godhood, while Tharun stands alone upon a throne of celestial steel.** A single **golden thread** winds down from the image of Tharun, its path left open-ended, as if waiting for the next thread of fate to be woven.

- **Leftmost Panel: The Shaper’s Shadow**
    - Blackened panel with silver threads.
    - Shows Abhaddanayla, the Shaper, with many hands twisting mortal fates.
    - Surrounding him are his progeny, once noble demigods now with fading divinity; smoke coils around them.

- **Second Panel: The Triumvirate of Dragons**
    - Depicts the three dragons in their prime:
        - **Meiraxeis:** Radiant white-gold, spear piercing the heavens.  
        - **Kaelgor:** Engulfed in seething flame, eyes ablaze with ambition.
        - **Tharun:** Enigmatic, shimmering in deep blue-violet, half-dissolved into shadow and starlight.
    - Their champions rise below, wielding divine weapons.
        
- **Third Panel: The Battlefield of Fallen Divinity**
    - A chaotic scene where Abhaddanayla’s progeny are shown falling, their divine halos shattering; screams are captured in frozen golden thread.
    - Kaelgor and Tharun are depicted as brothers-in-arms fighting against a tide of abyssal chaos.
    - Meiraxeis appears high above, weaving a massive spell as her wing edges fray.
    
- **Fourth Panel: The Clash of Fates**
    - A swirling, tumultuous battle unfolds in this panel.
    - Mortal champions and celestial warriors engage in desperate combat as divine energies collide.
    - Bright flashes and deep shadows illustrate sacrifices and the raw power of the divine conflict, hinting at the cost of the war.
    
- **Fifth Panel: Birth of the Abyss**
    - A jagged rift tears through the fabric of the tapestry, symbolizing the creation of the Abyss.
    - Meiraxeis is depicted unraveling, her soul cast into a swirling void.
    - Abhaddanayla is absent, his fate shrouded in mysterious chains.
    
- **Sixth Panel: The Betrayal**
    - A moment of stillness: Kaelgor stands alone, eyes dark with unquenched hunger, before the radiant figure of Tharun.
    - Golden stitches on Kaelgor’s form flicker with crimson and black—signs of his impending fall.
    
- **Seventh Panel: The Duel of Divinity**
    - A dramatic, dynamic scene showing a direct confrontation between Kaelgor and Tharun.
    - Tharun is portrayed as serene yet formidable, radiating a calming, celestial light.
    - Kaelgor is consumed by ambition and darkness; their weapons and magic clash in bursts of flame and radiance.
    - This intense duel hints at the eventual downfall of Kaelgor and the ascension of Tharun.
    
- **Final Panel: The Aftermath**
    - A stark scene: Kaelgor, diminished and kneeling in shadow with fractured divinity, while Tharun stands alone upon a throne of celestial steel.
    - A single golden thread descends from Tharun’s image, its path left open-ended for fate’s next weave.


Hallway, trapped mirror maze, upon entering wisdom save DC 20 or confused for the next 2 minutes, perception/inv DC 20 to see the trap

Room of tapestry, Altar in the centre, three plinths, holding sigils in the centre, one of Tharun, History DC 15 Kaelgor, and Meiraxeis (unknown). Upon completing tapestry sinks into the floor and the volcanic rock melts into the floor as magma.


Lair actions:
First room - **Effect:**

When a creature steps within **5 feet** of an active glyph, the glyph **erupts in divine power**, forcing all creatures within **10 feet** to make a **DC 14 Dexterity saving throw**. On a failure, the target suffers one of the following effects, depending on the nature of the glyph:

1. **Wrath of Meiraxeis (Radiant Glyph)** – A golden explosion of radiant fire engulfs the area. Affected creatures take **16 (3d10) radiant damage** and are **blinded** until the start of their next turn. On a success, they take half damage and are not blinded.
    
2. **Judgment of the Lost (Necrotic Glyph)** – A wave of withering energy lashes out. Affected creatures take **16 (3d10) necrotic damage**, and their maximum hit points are reduced by the same amount until they take a long rest. On a success, they take half damage with no max HP reduction.
    
3. **Seal of Tharun (Force Glyph)** – A pulse of divine force blasts outward. Affected creatures take **12 (3d8) force damage** and are **pushed 15 feet back**. On a success, they take half damage and are not pushed.
    
4. **Binding of the Faithless (Restraint Glyph)** – Ethereal chains shoot from the glyph, attempting to bind the target. The affected creature must make a **DC 14 Strength saving throw** or be **restrained for 1 minute**. The restrained creature may attempt the save again at the end of each of its turns.
5. **Countermeasures:**

- **Detect Magic** (reveals glyphs as divine abjurations).
    
- **Arcana or Religion DC 15** (to recognize their nature and divine purpose).
    
- **Thieves' Tools DC 16** (to carefully scrape the glyph away without triggering it).
    
- **Channel Divinity (Turn Undead or similar holy effect)** (deactivates one glyph within 10 feet).
    
- **Passage of a devout follower of Tharun** (or a character who has proven divine worth) may **suppress the glyphs' effects** within a 10-foot radius.
    

#### **Additional Challenge:**

- **Resetting Mechanism:** If the glyphs are **not all disabled**, they **recharge after 1 minute**, forcing cautious movement.
    
- **Statue Activation:** If the central **statue of Meiraxeis is disturbed without proper reverence**, **all glyphs in the room activate simultaneously**, creating a deadly chain reaction.

Second room - Hallway, trapped mirror maze, upon entering wisdom save DC 20 or confused for the next 2 minutes, perception/inv DC 20 to see the trap

Third room - First plinth requires evocation, the touch of a loyal friend or disciple, and third requires blood sacrifice
