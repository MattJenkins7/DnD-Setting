- 3/day: **Suggestion, Detect Thoughts**
    
- 1/day: **Dominate Person**

### **Actions**

**Dark Invocation (Recharge 5-6).** Rallos channels a fragment of Abhaddan’s will. One creature within 60 feet must make a **DC 15 Wisdom saving throw** or become **stunned until the end of its next turn**.

**Corrupting Grasp (Melee Spell Attack).** _+7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature._ Hit: **18 (4d6 + 4) necrotic damage**, and the target cannot regain hit points until the end of Rallos’ next turn.

---

### **Reactions**

**Warp Reality (1/Day).** When an enemy within 30 feet targets Rallos with an attack, he may use his reaction to teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space and leave behind an illusory copy of himself (as _Mirror Image_).

---

### **Tactics**

- **Rallos avoids direct combat,** staying in the backline while Meinos fights.
    
- He **prioritizes control**, using _Hold Person_, _Dominate Person_, and _Phantasmal Killer_ to weaken enemies.
    
- If threatened, he uses **Misty Step or Greater Invisibility** to retreat.
    
- When desperate, he calls upon **Dark Invocation** or **Wall of Force** to isolate enemies.
