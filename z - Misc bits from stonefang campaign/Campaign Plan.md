Tharun was created by abhaddan in the beginning to cleanse the land of evil before it was to be shaped, alongside his siblings and a dark blue dragon. Galin galandel who was a devout follower of piknos the blink dog and brother meinos, despite being somewhat of a forgotten religion. When tharun, and the old gods including meinos and piknos as well as the five others, and tharun's siblings meiraxeis, who gave her life to create the abyss and kael'gor fought the tyrannical abhaddan to banish him tharun was elected as the stoic and almight protectorate. Meinos embodies dependability and was taken as a sigil by the revered elven wizard galin galandel when he learned of him. Galin has since been killed by blue dragons which were used to guise the assailant as a follower of tharun when in actuality he was killed as the start of the saga involving the reassension of abhaddan through the loyal meinos, who was acting as a facilitator in the material plane. This was because galin owned the basin which contained the souls of the dryads of the withering grove that were the most powerful preserved living magic in the land and would enable a being as strong as abhaddan to be ripped through the plane. Galin was friends of pre-possessed rallos and was spoken about in his notes. Could you tell me why galin took piknos as a sigil,



Rallos constantly out of town going places never telling where he was going

Plague from the duergar in the south oryn knows of it through the correspondence through the duergar dwarf kavn keel spoke of delusions and hallucinations after heading to the withering grove

It is a known theory that communication between planes is done through the leylines in spaces of high dimensional frequencies. Rallos was not operating in these.
