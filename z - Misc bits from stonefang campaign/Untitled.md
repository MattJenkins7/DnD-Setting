#### Remnants of the undead hords of thaudarii left to fight as the visions of rallos vanish from sight, as meinos bounds into one and disappears at an instant with the vision


#### Josh has the ring stripped from him
#### When the big fight happens, magmodo begins twisting and turning, writhing as his form is manipulated into the form of a dragon, resembling those that attacked josh's patron


#### Something about the souls of the basin


#### Spirit of magmodo used in a room leading on from the first chamber in altar saying something about sacrifice to gain effects of a long rest +20% of your HP as THP. The amount used will reduce magmodo's CR by 1/4  each from 12 down to 3 (12->9 9->6 6->3).
resembles the altar in the council building, players can use one of the 3 spirit charges they have to cast wish and weaken magmodo for the fight.



#### During fight, smoke cloud as lair action around round 3 disorients the players.


#### Each round up until round 10 abhaddanayla is not summoned yet and so the hp of rallos is abhaddan's HP (100) AC of 16 + Shield Reaction + Abhaddan's Legendary actions.



#### Those who enter a close range (20ft) with the portal feel their lifeforce being sucked out of them, as is happening with those inside the basin

#### Portal is appearing above the Altar.


#### Room is brightly lit


#### At the start of Every round magmodo loses 10% of his HP 
###### Magmodo cannot be damaged, he has HP and THP, his THP is = to his HP and each time it reduces to 0 he is drawn back to the ring and the wearer (Rallos) must expend an action to resummon him (at full hp)
