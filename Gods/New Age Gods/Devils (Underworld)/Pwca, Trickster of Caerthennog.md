Lord of Lies, and Dealer of the Desperate, Pwca is a gambler, a twisted goblinoid creature known for the greed and cunning he possesses. He makes deals with those with nowhere else to turn. A cruel beast and ruler of the 5th belt; [[Plains/Cthnyxia (Underworld)/Belts/Caerthennog/-- Caerthennog Hub --|Caerthennog]].

Pwca absolves in the form of a hunched, grinning goblin with long arms, hunched back, and patchwork noble garments stitched with the debt-symbols of a thousand lost souls. His eyes roll dice when he blinks. His spine is an abacus.
