A thesis on the possibility of opening a controlled window into another plane using an anchored soul. Rallos argues that a sufficiently attuned soul could resonate with a plane and act as a conduit for messages. The book includes his calculations and schematics for a planar listening device.


- _"The Soul Window works. At first, only faint impressionsâ€”like hearing someone hum a song behind a locked door. Now, it speaks to me."_
- _"I have modified the device to allow a stronger connection. My dreams are filled with its voice. It offers knowledge. Answers."_
