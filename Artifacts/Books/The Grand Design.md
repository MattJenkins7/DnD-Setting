A scholarly attempt to categorize and define the planes based on their magical properties, positioning the Nexus Core as the origin of all things and theorizing that each subsequent plane represents a dilution of pure reality. It does not mention the Abyss, only dismissing the idea of an “unmapped plane” as superstition.


- _"Could an unmapped plane exist? The Nexus Core has perfect symmetry, yet something tugs at its edge. I must investigate further."_
- _"Theoretical inconsistencies in planar energy—if Thryne is correct, something must be siphoning magic away. Could this be a hidden realm?"_


- _"He still clings to order. The Abyss was not hidden. It was sealed_."
