**To Rallos,**

I do not know if this will reach you, nor if you would even care to read it if it did. It has been **years** since I last heard from you, and I find myself hoping that silence is the mark of a man lost in his work rather than one lost altogether.

We used to debate the shape of things, remember? You, ever the scholar, sought **patterns in the threads of the world**, while I—well, I preferred the things I could hold in my hands. You always had a mind for the **impossible**, but now I hear **rumors**.

They say you have buried yourself in your books. That you do not write, do not eat, barely sleep. That you chase something you cannot name. Tell me it is not true, Rallos. Tell me you have not let **your mind slip into the cracks you used to fear.**

I have **left Stonefang** behind. There is no life for me there anymore, but if you ever choose to see the sun again, you will find me in **the trader’s rest at Skyhold.** We could share a drink, or perhaps just a silence that does not press like a weight upon the soul.

Take care, old friend. And if you can—**write me back this time.**

**—Oryn**
