describing an event known as the "Abyssal Dawn," where a trapped being will rise and consume reality. It speaks of a figure who will open the gate and become the vessel. The passages shift unnaturally, as though rewritten over time.

Annotations in Common (Rallos' Final Notes):

- _"This is nonsense. Apocalyptic prophecy meant to frighten children. No single being could act as a vessel for such power."_
- _"And yet... when I dream now, I see the gate. And I stand before it. And I feel myself walking forward."_
