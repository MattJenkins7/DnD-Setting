## Roleplay Notes

### Personality Concept

A crazy old goblin scientist who uses syringes filled with his homemade poisons and chemicals instead of traditional weapons. Brilliant but antisocial, having spent years in isolation perfecting his craft.

### Flavor

- "Poison dagger" attacks are actually syringe injections
- Spell attacks involve throwing vials or using spray devices
- Sneak attacks represent hitting vital points with precise injections
- Experimental elixirs are strange brews with unpredictable effects
- Carries multiple vials and syringes at all times
- Excited by new specimens or rare components
